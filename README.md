Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying and preventing unauthorized or fraudulent credit card transactions. This typically involves detecting suspicious patterns or anomalies in transaction data that may indicate fraud. Fraudulent credit card activity leads to significant financial losses for both cardholders and financial institutions.

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data and predict potentially fraudulent activity. Through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis, the goal is to create an effective fraud detection system capable of differentiating between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
